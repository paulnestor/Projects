Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here you will find two projects that I've been working on:

#### Project1: PharmaSymptom Guide

Description: The idea behind my project is a virtual assistant that can provide personalized recommendations of over-the-counter solutions for some health concerns like the flu, 
smoking cessation and solar burn, based on some informations the users are asked to provide.


#### Project2: Dosage Calculator

Description: With this project, I decided to creat an easier, faster and safer way of validating the prescription of certain drugs precribed by physicians.
